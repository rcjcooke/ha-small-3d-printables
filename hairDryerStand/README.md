## Hair Dryer and GHD Stands
My wife currently puts her hair dryer and straighteners (GHDs) on a shelf in the dressing room. Rather than take up shelf space and have the cable clutter I designed stands for them to attach to the side of the shelves.

3D Printing files and details can be found here: [MyMiniFactory link](https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-hair-dryer-and-straightener-brackets-95211)

These stands are designed around a standard pair of GHDs and a large hair dryer (Philips Salon Proceramic Diamond) and it's assumed that they're mounted to a vertical surface using mounting tape (i.e. there are no mounting holes in the design)

The GHD stand prints as a single component and can be immediately mounted with no post processing. The hair dryer stand comes in two components, the ring and the mounting clip. These are separate so that you don't need large supports in the print. To allow for no post-processing, the ring has some built-in leeway around the mount to the clip. The ring must be glued on to the clip before use. I recommend a very strong glue such as super-glue or Gorilla glue.

This has been printed on my FlashForge Inventor in PLA and prints easily with no need for any additional supports, rafts or brims.

Happy Printing!
